# ðŸ§  LSTM Next Word Prediction

This project implements a **Next Word Prediction** model using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network in Python with TensorFlow/Keras. Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the most likely next word, trained on a custom or publicly available text corpus.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Tokenizes and vectorizes input text data.
- Builds and trains an LSTM-based neural network.
- Predicts the next word given a partial sentence.
- Supports saving/loading models and tokenizers.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for preprocessing)
- tqdm (for progress visualization)

Install dependencies:
